Usage: "makelatex <hw number>"

About: Scrapes URL from Prof Aviv's website, parses HTML and generates a decent looking latex document for the HW.

Disclaimers:
- HW NUMBERS MUST BE 2 DIGITS LONG
- PUT THE FILE IN YOUR "/bin/" OR ".local/bin" OR "/usr/bin/" AND RUN "chmod +x makelatex"
- MAKE SURE YOU UPDATE YOUR PYTHON LIBRARIES OR IT WON'T WORK
- I'm working on functionality to handle script snippits (right now they just show up as ugly plaintext)
